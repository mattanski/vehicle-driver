# vehicle-driver


This repository contains a simple program that simulates driving a vehicle, allowing the user to enter the driver's name and vehicle speed. The goal of the project is to provide an example of how to represent data about a vehicle and its driver through code.

Operation
The program allows the user to enter the name of the driver and the current speed of the vehicle. A message will then appear showing the details of the driver and the speed of the vehicle.
